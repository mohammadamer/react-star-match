# Star Match Game Project Rebuild Prompt

Rebuild a browser-based Star Match game using React and Node.js. The game should display stars and allow users to select numbers that sum to the star count, with real-time feedback and a timer. Use the following project structure:

- src/: All React components and game logic
- assets/: Static images and resources
- public/: index.html and static files
- package.json: Dependencies (react, react-dom, node, etc.)
- tsconfig.json: TypeScript config

## Game Requirements
- Main game board shows random stars (1-9)
- User selects numbers to match the star count
- Selected numbers are marked as used and cannot be reused
- Game ends when all numbers are used or timer runs out
- Responsive UI, clear win/loss feedback, and restart option
- Use functional components, hooks, and ES6+ features
- Style with CSS or styled-components

## Additional Instructions
- Include README.md with instructions to run and play the game.
- Ensure all code is in TypeScript and follows best practices for React projects.
