This is React game. I named it Star Match, and it's a simple math skills game for kids. The game is simple. When it starts, the player gets a random number of stars between 1 and 9 and also the fixed set of numbers from 1 to 9. The goal is to use all nine numbers. For each random number of stars, the player needs to pick one or more numbers that sum to the number of stars. So for 2, I can pick 2. For 4 stars, I have 2 options. I can either pick 4 or I can pick 3 plus 1. For 9, I have 2 options here as well. I can either pick 9 directly or 4 plus 5. Now while the player is picking numbers, they get marked as candidates because it's not a complete answer. And if they pick more than the count of stars, numbers get marked as wrong, and the player can unpick these candidates or wrong numbers to be able to pick a correct sum. And the game will always draw a number of stars that is playable. So, for example, in this case, we only have 1, 2, and 6 available, so the only number of stars that get drawn are either 1, 2, 6 or the combination of them. A timer should be also added to make the game a little bit more interesting and harder to win. If the timer runs out and you're not done picking all the numbers, the game is over. And you can always click Play Again to reset everything about this game and play again. Let's try to win this time. We've got 9. We have 8, 4, 9. We could do 6 and 3, 3. We could do 2 and 1. And then we have 7 and 5. And that was a close one.
